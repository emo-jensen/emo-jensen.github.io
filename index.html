                    <p class="about__description">In this project, I collaborated extensively with other developers, focusing primarily on design. My responsibilities included defining our goals for combat, communicating them to the team, and specifying features for programmers and animators. I learned the importance of clear communication and visual mockups to avoid misunderstandings, and realized the drawbacks of waiting on animations before implementing functionality. Experimenting with unique gameplay elements, such as the player protecting a sleeping child instead of having their own health, aligned with the game's theme but caused gameplay issues. Despite some setbacks, the project was a valuable learning experience, and I am proud of the collaborative effort.</p>

                  <p class="about__description-right">Out of all my solo projects, this one is the largest. I worked on everything, from story and art to music and design, and it was very rewarding. While making this game, I honed my ability to stay focused without needing deadlines or someone else's expectations. I also discovered some of the joys of designing and implementing for a real-time RPG, like not really needing hitboxes and being able to differentiate enemies using their stats. Something I didn't expect to practice during the project was level design, but I ended up needing to relearn some of the fundamental concepts in order to make a level that people won't get lost in (as often). Being a solo developer, getting playtesters wasn't as easy as it could have been, but I did find quite a few people to test the game and it helped me tune some features. One tester, for instance, commented on the game's cooldowns being to slow, which ended up being very true, and another told me they wished they could move faster, and after adding a sprint button the game feels way better. These testers helped me see the value of play testing for design. All in all, this was a very fun project and I'm pretty happy with the result.</p>

                    <p class="about__description">This project posed some interesting design challenges. The combat system lets you use gems that you've acquired throughout the game to enhance your attacks. There are a few different types of gems, like one that temporarily improves the main character's stats and one that inflicts a condition on the enemy, and part of the fun of the system is mixing up what gem you're using. During testing, however, me and the team noticed that most players found a gem they liked and kept using only that one. We discussed a few solutions to encourage players to vary their gem usage, like giving gems durability or cooldowns, but the one I ended up implementing was a system that powers up the next gem used if you use different gems three turns in a row. The idea being that we encourage varied gem use and strategy rather than punish repeated gem use. This mechanic was difficult to communicate to players, but once they understood it they really enjoyed it. I am also quite happy with how the combat turned out.</p>

                  <p class="about__description-right">This project started as a 48-hour game jam but I liked it enough to keep working on it occasionally. Initially, the game was meant to be all about throwing enemies into walls and each other, but since it would feel weird to not be able to attack I also added a sledgehammer attack. When people tested the game, they told me they loved how heavy and juicy the combat mechanics felt, largely due to the hammer's animation and how effective throwing enemies was. After the jam, I added lots of enemies and a proper level, which made it feel much more like a real game. Something I felt was lagging behind, oddly enough, was the juice that was there when jam-goers tested it. Because the rest of the game felt more complete, there not being controller rumble and hit stop was clashing with the rest of the system. I added both features and discovered just how much better they can make a game feel. I am very proud of how juicy the combat of this game is now!</p>
